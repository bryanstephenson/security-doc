Ceph credentials included in logs using older versions of libvirt/qemu
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Summary ###
Older versions of libvirt included network storage authentication
information on the qemu command line. If libvirt raises an exception
which logs the qemu command line it used, for example an error starting
a domain, this authentication information will available in the logs.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Versions 2.5 and earlier of QEMU and libvirt versions of 2.1 or ealier.

The issue has been resolved in all QEMU versions 2.6 and above and
libvirt 2.2 and above.

No patches or specific releases of Nova or Ceph are required, the
issue is completely resolved in QEMU and libvirt.

### Discussion ###
If a deployment is using ceph, a libvirt error starting a domain would
log the cephx secret key and the monitor addresses on the qemu command
line.

A local attacker could then use this flaw to gain access of the cephx
secret key and perform certain privileged operations within the cluster.

An existing CVE is already present for this issue [1].

### Recommended Actions ###
The issue has been resolved upstream. Users running qemu version 2.6 or
later, and libvirt version 2.2 or later, are not vulnerable.

No change is required in Nova or Ceph to resolve this issue.
