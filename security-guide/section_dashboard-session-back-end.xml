      <title>Session back end</title>
      <para>The default session back end for horizon
        (<literal>django.contrib.sessions.backends.signed_cookies</literal>)
        saves user data in signed, but unencrypted cookies stored in the
        browser. Due to the fact that each dashboard instance is
        stateless, the previously mentioned methodology provides the
        ability to implement the most simple session back-end scaling.</para>
      <para>It should be noted that with this type of implementation
        sensitive access tokens will be stored in the browser and will be
        transmitted with each request made. The back end ensures the
        integrity of session data, even though the transmitted data
        is only encrypted by HTTPS.</para>
      <para>If your architecture allows it, we recommend using
        <literal>django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache</literal> as
        your session back end with memcache as the cache. Memcache must
        not be exposed publicly, and should communicate over a secured
        private channel. If you choose to use the signed cookies
        back end, refer to the Django documentation to understand the
        security trade-offs.</para>
