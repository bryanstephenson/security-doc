      <title>Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</title>
      <para>Unlike many similar systems, the OpenStack dashboard allows the
        entire Unicode character set in most fields. This means
        developers have less latitude to make escaping mistakes that
        open attack vectors for cross-site scripting (XSS).</para>
      <para>Dashboard provides tools for developers to avoid creating
        XSS vulnerabilities, but they only work if developers use them
        correctly. Audit any custom dashboards, paying particular
        attention to use of the <literal>mark_safe</literal> function,
        use of <literal>is_safe</literal> with
        custom template tags, the <literal>safe</literal> template tag, anywhere
        auto escape
        is turned off, and any JavaScript which might evaluate
        improperly escaped data.</para>
