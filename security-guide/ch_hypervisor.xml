  <title>Hypervisor and virtualization layer</title>

  <para>
    Virtualization can provide flexibility, improved resource
    utilization, faster provisioning, and other benefits that enable
    cloud computing. The virtualization stack can also provide
    isolation between guest virtual machines, however, appropriate
    security measures must be considered to reduce the risks
    associated with hypervisor breakout attacks.
