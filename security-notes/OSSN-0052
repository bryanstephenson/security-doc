Python-swiftclient exposes raw token values in debug logs
---

### Summary ###
The password and authentication token configuration options for the
python-swiftclient are not marked as secret. The values of these options
will be logged to the standard logging output when the controller is run
in debug mode.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Python-swiftclient, Swift, Glance, Juno, Kilo

### Discussion ###
When using the python-swiftclient to connect to Glance, and the
:glance-api.conf: has set the value of the debug option to True, the
requests sent through the API, including user and token details, will be
captured in the local log mechanism.

### Recommended Actions ###
It is recommended to use the debug level in configurations only when
necessary to troubleshoot an issue. When the debug flag is set, the
resulting logs should be treated as having sensitive information and as
such should have strict permissions around the file and containing
directory set in the operating system. Additionally, the logs should
not be transported off the system in plaintext such as through syslog.

The debug level can be turned off by setting the following option in
the `glance-api.conf` file:

    [DEFAULT]
    debug = false
