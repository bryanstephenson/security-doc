Nova Baremetal is insecure for use in multi-tenant environments
---

### Summary ###
Data of previous tenants may be exposed to new ones when using Nova
Baremetal.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Nova Baremetal, All Releases

### Discussion ###
Nova Baremetal is intended for testing and development only, it is not
intended to be production ready. Experience has shown that despite that
warning the OpenStack community is keen to embrace new technologies and
deploy at-risk. This OSSN serves to signpost some of the risks.

Without secure boot, and without full openflow hardware networking
during the boot process, it is impossible to trust multiple tenants on
baremetal at all - because the vectors for attack are so low level that
instances may be running in a virtual environment and unaware of it,
with the virtual environment capturing secrets, forcing entropy pools to
be predictable and other such hostile behaviour.

### Recommended Actions ###
Do not use Nova Baremetal where secure separation of tenants on hardware
is a requirement without a full verifiable boot chain and network
hardware.
