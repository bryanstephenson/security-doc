MongoDB guest instance allows any user to connect
---

### Summary ###
When creating a new MongoDB single instance or cluster the default setting in
MongoDB `security.authorization` was set as disabled. This resulted in no need
to provide user credentials to connect to the mongo instance and perform read /
write operations from any network that is attached on instance create.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Trove, Liberty

### Discussion ###
MongoDB contains a security config set within `mongo.conf` as follows:

    security:
        authorization: "enabled"

When creating a new MongoDB instance, or cluster within Trove the `security`
value was not populated resulting in MongoDB adopting the default value of
`disabled`. With security authorization disabled there would be no enforcement
of user authentification, allowing users to connect and perform read/write data
operations from any network that is attached on instance create.

A fix was implemented within Mitaka and back ported to Liberty that addresses
the problem by enabling authorization by default on single instances. This can
be toggled via configuration groups.

Cluster security is determined by the Trove config variable
`mongodb.cluster_secure`. This cannot be toggled once the cluster is created.

### Recommended Actions ###
Single instances are now use role based access control (RBAC) by default. To
disable RBAC, the Trove user can attach a security group with
`security.authorization` set to `disabled`. It can be re-enabled by detaching
the security group or changing the value to `enabled`.

The Trove config variable `mongodb.cluster_secure`
(boolean type, in `trove.conf`) determines the RBAC state of MongoDB clusters
that are created. Setting this to true enables RBAC while false disables it.
This applies to all MongoDB clusters, and requires a restart of the trove-api
service to change, and cannot be toggled on running clusters.
