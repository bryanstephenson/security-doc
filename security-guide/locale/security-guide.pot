When configuring the trusted certificate authority (CA) bundle that your messaging server uses to verify client connections, it is recommended that this be limited to only the CA used for your nodes, preferably an internally managed CA. The bundle of trusted CAs will determine which client certificates will be authorized and pass the client-server verification step of the setting up the TLS connection.

Even if everyone that is allowed to access your management network is 100% trusted, there is still a threat that an unauthorized user gains access to your internal network by exploiting a misconfiguration or software vulnerability. One must keep in mind that you have users running their own code on instances in the OpenStack Compute nodes, which are deployed on the management network.

A proven SSL implementation that performs well would be used. The same SSL proxy software would be used for all services, so SSL configuration for the API endpoints would be consistent.

She is aware that her private cloud will need to be certified against FISMA through the FedRAMP accreditation process required for all federal agencies, departments, and contractors as well as being under HIPAA purview. These compliance frameworks will place the burden of effort around logging, reporting, and policy. While technical controls will require Alice to use Public Key Infrastructure to encrypt wire-level communication, and SELinux for Mandatory Access Controls, Alice will invest in tool development to automate the reporting. Additionally, comprehensive documentation is expected covering application and network architecture, controls, and other details. The FedRAMP classification of Alice's system is High per FIPS-199. Alice will leverage existing authentication/authorization infrastructure in the form of Microsoft Active Directory, and an existing enterprise SEIM deployment that she will use to build new views and correlation rules to better monitor the state of her cloud."

It is relatively easy for an end-user to encrypt their data prior to saving it to the cloud, and this is a viable path for tenant objects such as media files, database archives among others. In some instances, client-side encryption is utilized to encrypt data held by the virtualization technologies which requires client interaction, such as presenting keys, to decrypt data for future use. To seamlessly secure the data and have it accessible without burdening the client with having to manage their keys and interactively provide them calls for a key management service within OpenStack. Providing encryption and key management services as part of OpenStack eases data-at-rest security adoption and addresses customer concerns about privacy or misuse of data, while also limiting cloud provider liability.
