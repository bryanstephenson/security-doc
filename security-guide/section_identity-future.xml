    <title>Future</title>
    <para>Domains are high-level containers for projects, users and
      groups. As such, they can be used to centrally manage all
      keystone-based identity components. With the introduction of
      account domains, server, storage and other resources can now be
      logically grouped into multiple projects (previously called
      tenants) which can themselves be grouped under a master
      account-like container. In addition, multiple users can be
      managed within an account domain and assigned roles that vary
      for each project.</para>
    <para>The Identity V3 API supports multiple domains. Users of
      different domains may be represented in different authentication
      back ends and even have different attributes that must be mapped
      to a single set of roles and privileges, that are used in the
      policy definitions to access the various service
      resources.</para>
    <para>Where a rule may specify access to only admin users and
      users belonging to the tenant, the mapping may be trivial. In
      other scenarios the cloud administrator may need to approve the
      mapping routines per tenant.</para>
