  <title>Hypervisor selection</title>
  <para>Virtualization provides flexibility and other key benefits
    that enable cloud building. However, a virtualization stack must
    also be secured appropriately to reduce the risks associated with
    hypervisor breakout attacks. That is, while a virtualization stack
    can provide isolation between instances, or guest virtual
    machines, that isolation can be less than perfect in some
    situations. Making intelligent selections for virtualization stack
    as well as following the best practices outlined in this chapter
    can be included in a layered approach to cloud security. Finally,
    securing your virtualization stack is critical to deliver on the
    promise of multi-tenant, either between customers in a public
    cloud, between business units in a private cloud, or some mixture
    of the two in a hybrid cloud.</para>
  <para>This chapter discusses the hypervisor selection process. The
    chapters that follow provide foundational information needed for
    securing a virtualization stack.</para>

    <title>Hypervisors in OpenStack</title>
    <para>Whether OpenStack is deployed within private data centers or
      as a public cloud service, the underlying virtualization
      technology provides enterprise-level capabilities in the realms
      of scalability, resource efficiency, and uptime. While such
      high-level benefits are generally available across many
      OpenStack-supported hypervisor technologies, there are
      significant differences in the security architecture and
      features for each hypervisor, particularly when considering the
      security threat vectors which are unique to elastic OpenStack
      environments. As applications consolidate into single
      Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platforms, instance isolation
      at the hypervisor level becomes paramount. The requirement for
      secure isolation holds true across commercial, government, and
      military communities.</para>
    <para>Within the OpenStack framework, you can choose among many
      hypervisor platforms and corresponding OpenStack plug-ins to
      optimize your cloud environment. In the context of this guide,
      hypervisor selection considerations are highlighted as they
      pertain to feature sets that are critical to security. However,
      these considerations are not meant to be an exhaustive
      investigation into the pros and cons of particular hypervisors.
      NIST provides additional guidance in Special Publication
      800-125, "<emphasis>Guide to Security for Full Virtualization
        Technologies</emphasis>".</para>

    <title>Selection criteria</title>
    <para>As part of your hypervisor selection process, you must
      consider a number of important factors to help increase your
      security posture. Specifically, you must become familiar with
      these areas:</para>

    <para>Additionally, the following security-related criteria are
      highly encouraged to be evaluated when selecting a hypervisor
      for OpenStack deployments:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Has the hypervisor undergone Common Criteria
          certification? If so, to what levels?</para>

    </itemizedlist>
    <section xml:id="team_expertise">
      <title>Team expertise</title>
      <para>Most likely, the most important aspect in hypervisor
        selection is the expertise of your staff in managing and
        maintaining a particular hypervisor platform. The more
        familiar your team is with a given product, its configuration,
        and its eccentricities, the fewer the configuration mistakes.
        Additionally, having staff expertise spread across an
        organization on a given hypervisor increases availability of
        your systems, allows segregation of duties, and mitigates
        problems in the event that a team member is
        unavailable.</para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="hypervisor-selection-idp252752">
      <title>Product or project maturity</title>
      <para>The maturity of a given hypervisor product or project is
        critical to your security posture as well. Product maturity
        has a number of effects once you have deployed your
        cloud:</para>

          <para>Availability of expertise</para>

          <para>Incidence response</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>One of the biggest indicators of a hypervisor's maturity
        is the size and vibrancy of the community that surrounds it.
        As this concerns security, the quality of the community
        affects the availability of expertise if you need additional
        cloud operators. It is also a sign of how widely deployed the
        hypervisor is, in turn leading to the battle readiness of any
        reference architectures and best practices.</para>
      <para>Further, the quality of community, as it surrounds an open
        source hypervisor like KVM or Xen, has a direct impact on the
        timeliness of bug fixes and security updates. When
        investigating both commercial and open source hypervisors, you
        must look into their release and support cycles as well as the
        time delta between the announcement of a bug or security issue
        and a patch or response. Lastly, the supported capabilities of
        OpenStack compute vary depending on the hypervisor chosen. See
        the <link
          xlink:href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/HypervisorSupportMatrix"

      <title>Certifications and attestations</title>
      <para>One additional consideration when selecting a hypervisor
        is the availability of various formal certifications and
        attestations. While they may not be requirements for your
        specific organization, these certifications and attestations
        speak to the maturity, production readiness, and thoroughness
        of the testing a particular hypervisor platform has been
        subjected to.</para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="hypervisor-selection-idp262672">
      <title>Common criteria</title>
      <para>Common Criteria is an internationally standardized
        software evaluation process, used by governments and
        commercial companies to validate software technologies perform
        as advertised. In the government sector, NSTISSP No. 11
        mandates that U.S. Government agencies only procure software
        which has been Common Criteria certified, a policy which has
        been in place since July 2002. It should be specifically noted
        that OpenStack has not undergone Common Criteria
        certification, however many of the available hypervisors
        have.</para>
      <para>In addition to validating a technologies capabilities, the
        Common Criteria process evaluates <emphasis>how</emphasis>

      <para>The KVM hypervisor has been Common Criteria certified
        through the U.S. Government and commercial distributions,
        which have been validated to separate the runtime environment
        of virtual machines from each other, providing foundational
        technology to enforce instance isolation. In addition to

      <title>Hypervisor vs. baremetal</title>
      <para>It is important to recognize the difference between using
        LXC (Linux Containers) or baremetal systems vs using a
        hypervisor like KVM. Specifically, the focus of this security
        guide is largely based on having a hypervisor and
        virtualization platform. However, should your implementation
        require the use of a baremetal or LXC environment, you must
        pay attention to the particular differences in regard to
        deployment of that environment.</para>
      <para>In particular, you must assure your end users that the
        node has been properly sanitized of their data prior to
        re-provisioning. Additionally, prior to reusing a node, you
        must provide assurances that the hardware has not been
        tampered or otherwise compromised.</para>
      <note>
        <para>While OpenStack has a baremetal project, a discussion of
          the particular security implications of running baremetal is

      <title>Hypervisor memory optimization</title>
      <para>Many hypervisors use memory optimization techniques to
        overcommit memory to guest virtual machines. This is a useful
        feature that allows you to deploy very dense compute clusters.
        One way to achieve this is through de-duplication or "sharing"
        of memory pages. When two virtual machines have identical data
        in memory, there are advantages to having them reference the
        same memory.</para>
      <para>Typically this is achieved through Copy-On-Write (COW)
        mechanisms. These mechanisms have been shown to be vulnerable
        to side-channel attacks where one VM can infer something about
        the state of another and might not be appropriate for
        multi-tenant environments where not all tenants are trusted or
        share the same levels of trust.</para>

      <title>KVM Kernel Samepage Merging</title>
      <para>Introduced into the Linux kernel in version 2.6.32, Kernel
        Samepage Merging (KSM) consolidates identical memory pages
        between Linux processes. As each guest VM under the KVM
        hypervisor runs in its own process, KSM can be used to
        optimize memory use between VMs.</para>

      <para>XenServer 5.6 includes a memory overcommitment feature

        chunks for any duplicates. When found, the Xen Virtual Machine
