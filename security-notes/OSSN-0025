Possible Glance image exposure via Swift
---

### Summary ###
Glance is able to use Swift as a back end for storing virtual machine
images. When Glance is configured this way (in multi-tenant mode only),
it is possible for unauthenticated users to access "public" virtual
machine images directly from Swift, even though Glance restricts access
to those images to authenticated users.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Glance, Swift, Havana, Icehouse

### Discussion ###
The 'delay_auth_decision' Swift variable modifies the ACL's to either
require authentication via Keystone or allow unauthenticated access.
When 'delay_auth_decision' is set to '1' the Swift ACL uses a wildcard
(*) to accept all incoming responses.

When Glance is configured for multi-tenant mode, this will allow all
tenants as well as unauthenticated users to have access to the Swift
'public' images.

This can happen when Swift and Glance are configured in the following
fashion:

---- begin example Swift proxy-server.conf snippet ----
  delay_auth_decision = 1
---- end example Swift proxy-server.conf snippet ----

---- begin example glance-api.conf snippet ----
  default_store = swift
  swift_store_multi_tenant = True
  swift_store_create_container_on_put = True
---- end example glance-api.conf snippet ----

One way to discover the URL is to take a snapshot of a public image. The
URL for the snapshot combined with the owner ID of the public image will
allow for the Swift URL of the public image to be inferred. This URL
can then be utilized anonymously to download the image.

### Recommended Actions ###
If your Swift and Glance services are configured in such a way that they
are vulnerable, it is recommended that Swift image requests are audited
to determine if an unauthorized image request was made. By default when
images are accessed a message is logged to the Swift log file.

Setting the Swift 'delay_auth_decision' value to '0' (False) will
require Keystone authentication to access the Swift containers, and is
only recommended for environments using Keystone for authentication.

Modifying the Glance configuration to not use Swift in multi-tenant
mode will mitigate the issue, but may introduce other issues depending
on what configuration is used.

Implementing an alternative back end (such as Ceph) will also remove
the issue, however will require additional knowledge on how to securely
install and configure the new object storage service.

The Swift and Glance configuration items are specific to a given
environment, so test configurations before deploying them in a
production environment.
