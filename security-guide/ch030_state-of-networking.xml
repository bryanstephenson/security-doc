    <title>State of networking</title>
    <para>OpenStack Networking in the Grizzly release enables the end-user or tenant to define, utilize, and consume networking resources in new ways that had not been possible in previous OpenStack Networking releases. OpenStack Networking provides a tenant-facing API for defining network connectivity and IP addressing for instances in the cloud in addition to orchestrating the network configuration. With the transition to an API-centric networking service, cloud architects and administrators should take into consideration best practices to secure physical and virtual network infrastructure and services.</para>
    <para>
      OpenStack Networking was designed with a plug-in architecture
      that provides extensibility of the API through open source
      community or third-party services. As you evaluate your
      architectural design requirements, it is important to determine
      what features are available in OpenStack Networking core
      services, any additional services that are provided by
      third-party products, and what supplemental services are
      required to be implemented in the physical
      infrastructure.</para>
    <para>This section is a high-level overview of what processes and best practices should be considered when implementing OpenStack Networking. We will talk about the current state of services that are available, what future services will be implemented, and the current limitations in this project.</para>
