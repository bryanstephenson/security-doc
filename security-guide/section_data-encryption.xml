    <title>Data encryption</title>
    <para>The option exists for implementers to encrypt tenant data wherever it is stored on disk or transported over a network, such as the OpenStack volume encryption feature described below. This is above and beyond the general recommendation that users encrypt their own data before sending it to their provider.</para>
    <para>The importance of encrypting data on behalf of tenants is largely related to the risk assumed by a provider that an attacker could access tenant data. There may be requirements here in government, as well as requirements per-policy, in private contract, or even in case law in regard to private contracts for public cloud providers. It is recommended that a risk assessment and legal consul advised before choosing tenant encryption policies.</para>
    <para>Per-instance or per-object encryption is preferable over, in descending order, per-project, per-tenant, per-host, and per-cloud aggregations. This recommendation is inverse to the complexity and difficulty of implementation. Presently, in some projects it is difficult or impossible to implement encryption as loosely granular as even per-tenant. We recommend implementors make a best-effort in encrypting tenant data.</para>
    <para>Often, data encryption relates positively to the ability to reliably destroy tenant and per-instance data, simply by throwing away the keys. It should be noted that in doing so, it becomes of great importance to destroy those keys in a reliable and secure manner.</para>

      <para>An ephemeral disk encryption feature addresses data privacy.  The ephemeral disk is a temporary work space used by the virtual host operating system.  Without encryption, sensitive user information could be accessed on this disk, and vestigial information could remain after the disk is unmounted.

      <title>Object Storage objects</title>
      <para>The ability to encrypt objects in Object Storage is presently limited to disk-level encryption per node. However, there does exist third-party extensions and modules for per-object encryption. These modules have been proposed upstream, but have not per this writing been formally accepted. Below are some pointers:</para>

      <title>Block Storage volumes and instance ephemeral filesystems</title>
      <para>Block Storage supports a variety of mechanisms for supplying mountable volumes. The ability to encrypt volumes on the storage host depends on the service back ends chosen. Some back ends may not support this at all. It is outside the scope of this guide to specify recommendations for each Block Storage back-end driver.</para>
      <para>For the purpose of performance, many storage protocols are unencrypted. Some protocols such as iSCSI can provide authentication and encrypted sessions, it is our recommendation to enable these features.</para>
      <para>As both block storage and compute support LVM backed storage, we can easily provide an example applicable to both systems. In deployments using LVM, encryption may be performed against the backing physical volumes. An encrypted block device would be created using the standard Linux tools, with the LVM physical volume (PV) created on top of the decrypted block device using pvcreate. Then, the vgcreate or vgmodify tool may be used to add the encrypted physical volume to an LVM volume group (VG).</para>

      <para>Tenant data for compute could be encrypted over IPsec or
      other tunnels. This is not functionality common or standard in
      OpenStack, but is an option available to motivated and
      interested implementors.</para>
      <para>Likewise, encrypted data will remain encrypted as it is transferred over the network.</para>
