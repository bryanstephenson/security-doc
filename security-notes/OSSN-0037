Configure Horizon to mitigate BREACH/CRIME attacks
---

### Summary ###
Horizon is vulnerable to BREACH/CRIME style chosen plaintext attacks in
it's default configuration.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Horizon, Django, Apache, Nginx, SSL, TLS

### Discussion ###
The BREACH attack may be used to compromise Django's cross-site request
forgery (CSRF) protection. OpenStack's Horizon web dashboard is built on
the Django framework, and is consequently affected. There is no fix
available in Horizon itself, but there are protection options.

BREACH takes advantage of vulnerabilities when serving compressed data
over SSL/TLS.

### Recommended Actions ###
Since BREACH is related to serving compressed data, disabling
compression of web responses can be used to mitigate these type of
attacks. Some methods for this include:

Disable Django's GZIP Middleware:

  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/middleware/#module-django.middleware.gzip

Disable GZip compression in your web server's config.  For Apache httpd,
you can do this by disabling mod_deflate:

  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_deflate.html

For Nginx, you can do this by disabling the gzip module:
