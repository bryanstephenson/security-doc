    The OpenStack Security Guide is the result of a five day sprint of
    collaborative work of many individuals. The purpose of this document
    is to provide the best practice guidelines for deploying a secure
    OpenStack cloud. It is a living document that is updated as new
    changes are merged into the repository, and is meant to reflect the
    current state of security within the OpenStack community and provide
    frameworks for decision making where listing specific security
    controls are not feasible due to complexity or other environment
    specific details.
