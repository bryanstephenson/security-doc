      The OpenStack Compute service (nova) is one of the more complex
      OpenStack services. It runs in many locations throughout the cloud
      and interacts with a variety of internal services. There are a
      variety of configuration options when using the OpenStack Compute
      service, and these can be deployment-specific. In this chapter we
      will call out general best practice around Compute security as
      well as specific known configurations that can lead to security
      issues. In general, the <filename>nova.conf</filename> file and
      the <filename>/var/lib/nova</filename> locations should be secured.
      Controls like centralized logging, the
      <filename>policy.json</filename> file, and a mandatory access
      control framework should be implemented. Additionally, there are
      environmental considerations to keep in mind, depending on what
      functionality is desired for your cloud.
