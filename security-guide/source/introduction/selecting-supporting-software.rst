Selecting supporting software
=============================

Your selection of supporting software, such as messaging and load balancing,
can have serious security impacts on your cloud.
It is important that you make the proper choices for your
organization. This section provides some general guidelines for
selecting supporting software.

In order to select the best supporting software, consider these factors:

* Team expertise
* Product or project maturity
* Common Criteria
* Hardware concerns

Team expertise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The more familiar your team is with a given product, its configuration, and
its eccentricities, the fewer configuration mistakes are made. Additionally,
having staff expertise spread across an organization increases availability of
your systems, allows segregation of duties, and mitigates problems in the event
that a team member is unavailable.

Product or project maturity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The maturity of a given product or project is critical to your security
posture. Product maturity has a number of effects after you deploy your
cloud:

* Availability of expertise
* Active developer and user communities
* Timeliness and availability of updates
* Incidence response

Common Criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Common Criteria <https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/>`_ is an
internationally standardized software evaluation process, used by governments
and commercial companies to validate that software technologies perform as
advertised.

Hardware concerns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the supportability of the hardware on which the software will run.
Additionally, consider the additional features available in the hardware and
how those features are supported by the software you choose.
