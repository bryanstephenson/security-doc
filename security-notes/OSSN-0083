Keystone policy rule "identity:get_identity_providers" was ignored
---

### Summary ###
A policy rule in Keystone did not behave as intended leading to a less
secure configuration than would be expected.

### Affected Services / Software ###
OpenStack Identity Service (Keystone) versions through Mitaka, as well
as Newton (<= 10.0.3), and Ocata (<= 11.0.3).

### Discussion ###
Deployments were unaffected by this problem if the default rule was
changed or the "get_identity_providers" rule was manually changed to
be "get_identity_provider" (singular) in keystone's `policy.json`.

A spelling mistake in the default policy configuration caused these
rules to be ignored. As a result operators that attempted to restrict
this API were unlikely to actually enforce it.

### Recommended Actions ###
Update Keystone to a minimum version of 12.0.0.0b3. Additionally, this
fix has been backported to Ocata (11.0.3) and Newton (10.0.3).

Fix any lingering rules: `identity:get_identity_providers` should
be changed to `identity:get_identity_provider`.
