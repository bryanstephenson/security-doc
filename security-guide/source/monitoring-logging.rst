Monitoring and logging
======================

Within a cloud environment there is a mixture of hardware,
operating systems, virtual machine managers, OpenStack services, cloud-user
activity (such as creating instances and attaching storage), networking,
and end-users using the applications running on the various instances.

The basics of logging: configuration, setting log level, location of the log
files, and how to use and customize logs, as well as how to do centralized
collections of logs is well covered in the `OpenStack Operations Guide
<https://docs.openstack.org/ops/>`_.
