Keystone logs auth tokens in URLs at the INFO log level
---

### Summary ###
When a client accesses Keystone using the Identity API version 2, the
tokens will be logged as part of some request URLs. Specifically all
requests to the tokens resource will be logged at the INFO level.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Keystone, Grizzly, Havana, Icehouse, Juno

### Discussion ###
Tokens are used to authorize users when making API requests against
OpenStack services. This allows previously authenticated users to make
API requests without providing their authentication information again,
such as their username and password.  This makes them very sensitive
when stored and transmitted on the wire. Ideally tokens should never be
stored on the disk to avoid the possibility of an attacker obtaining
local storage access and reusing them in the system.

Keystone logs the request URLs at the INFO level in order to make the
system operations and support easier. Unfortunately when the tokens
resource is accessed, the URLs include the user's secret token, like
in this case: (single line, wrapped)

---- begin example keystone.log snippet ----
INFO eventlet.wsgi.server [-] 10.0.0.66 - - [22/Aug/2014 12:39:01]
  "GET /v2.0/tokens/<plaintext_token> HTTP/1.1" 403 325 0.006539
---- end example keystone.log snippet ----

Large systems often use remote logging mechanisms, which may use
unencrypted protocols such as syslog/udp. This could lead to
distributing the logfile entries containing tokens in plaintext over
untrusted networks. The target log collection systems may also use
different authorization rules than the local log files, which could
enable access to the tokens by support staff, or to third parties
storing the logs.

Additionally any load balancers and proxies processing the same request
may be logging the URL on their own. Their configuration and solution to
this problem is out of scope of this note and they should be checked
separately.

Version 3 of the Identity API does not pass the tokens in the URLs
anymore. This information is sent using the request headers or POST data
instead.

### Recommended Actions ###
Where possible, users and services interacting with the Keystone service
should be using the Identity API v3 endpoint. If that's not possible,
restricting the Keystone's logging level to WARN will fix the immediate
problem at the cost of removing potentially useful log information. Due
to various ways Keystone may be deployed and configured, interaction of
the 'debug', 'verbose', 'default_log_levels' and any wsgi server options
should be considered for this change. Keystone deployed via servers
other than eventlet will need their own solution.

If logging of all requests is required, this may be achieved by using a
third-party proxy, like Apache or Nginx with a configuration that does
not write the complete URL into the logs. For example Nginx can be
configured to switch to a customised log format using directive
'access_log' only for requests matching location '/v2.0/tokens/...'.
