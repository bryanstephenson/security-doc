copy_from in Image Service API v1 allows network port scan
----------------------------------------------------------

### Summary ###
The `copy_from` feature in Image Service API v1 supplied by Glance can
allow an attacker to perform masked network port scans.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Version 1 of the Glance Image Service (deprecated in Newton).

### Discussion ###
In Version 1 of the Glance Image Service API it is possible to create
images with a URL such as `http://localhost:22`. This could then allow
an attacker to enumerate internal network details while appearing
masked, since the scan would appear to originate from the Glance image
service.

### Recommended Actions ###
Version 1 of the Glance Image Service API was deprecated in the Newton
cycle, so operators should upgrade to a later version that will allow
use of Version 2.

Existing deployments can limit policy on `copy_from` by restricting use
to `admin` within `policy.json` as follows:

    "copy_from": "role:admin"
