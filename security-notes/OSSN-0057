DoS attack on Glance service can lead to interruption or disruption
---

### Summary ###
The typical Glance workflow allows authenticated users to create an
image and upload the image content in a separate step. This can be
abused by malicious users to flood the Glance database with entries
for zero sized images.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Glance, Icehouse, Juno, Kilo, Liberty

### Discussion ###
Glance by default allows an authenticated user to create zero size
images. Those images do not consume resources on the storage backend
and do not hit any limits for size, but do take up space in the
database.

Malicious users can potentially cause database resource depletion with
an endless flood of 'image-create' requests.

### Recommended Actions ###
For current stable OpenStack releases, users can workaround this
vulnerability by using rate-limiting proxies to cover access to the
Glance API.  Rate-limiting is a common mechanism to prevent DoS and
Brute-Force attacks.  Rate limiting on the API requests allows a delay
in the consequences of the attack, but does not prevent it.

For example, if you are using a proxy such as Repose, enable the rate
limiting feature by following these steps:

  https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/Rate+Limiting+Filter

An alternative approach to mitigate this issue would be to restrict
image creates to trusted administrators within your deployed Glance
policy.json file.

  "add_image": "role:admin",

Another preventative action would be to monitor the logs to identify
excessive image create requests.  One example of such a log message
is as follows (single line, wrapped):

---- begin example glance-api.log snippet ----
DEBUG glance.registry.client.v1.api [req-da1cafc0-f41f-4587-a484-672ba7f3546e
admin 8b04efc28055428c940505838314f262 - - -]

/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/glance/registry/client/v1/api.py:161
---- end example glance-api.log snippet ----
