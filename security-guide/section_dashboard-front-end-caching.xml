      <title>Front end caching</title>
      <para>Since the dashboard is rendering dynamic content passed directly
        from OpenStack API requests, we do not recommend front end
        caching layers such as varnish. In Django, static media is
        directly served from Apache or nginx and already benefits from
        web host caching.</para>
