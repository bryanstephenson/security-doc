HTTP Strict Transport Security not enabled on Horizon Dashboard
---

### Summary ###
Deployers using Horizon for production or internet facing operations
should strongly consider configuring HTTP Strict Transport Security
(HSTS) for their deployment.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Horizon, SSL, TLS, Apache, Nginx

### Discussion ###
HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) enforces that all communications
with a server go over SSL. This mitigates the threat from attacks such
as SSL-Strip which replaces links on the wire, stripping away https
prefixes and potentially allowing an attacker to view confidential
information on the wire.

HSTS can be enabled in Apache and Nginx, the two primary ways of serving
Horizon at scale.

### Recommended Actions ###
If using Apache httpd to host Horizon, add the following to the relevant
'VirtualHost' entry in your Apache httpd configuration file:

  --- begin example httpd configuration snippet ---
  Header add Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=15768000"
  --- end example httpd configuration snippet ---

We suggest also using mod_rewrite to ensure all visitors to Horizon land
on a secure page. To accomplish this, add the following into your Apache
httpd configuration file:

  --- begin example httpd configuration snippet ---
  <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
    RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}
  </IfModule>
  --- end example httpd configuration snippet ---

If using Nginx to host Horizon, add the following to your Nginx
configuration file:

  --- begin example Nginx configuration snippet ---
  add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=15768000;
  --- end example Nginx configuration snippet ---

As always, test these configuration settings before deploying them to
production in order to catch any bugs or errors.
