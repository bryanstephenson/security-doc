    <title>Basic web server configuration</title>
    <para>The dashboard should be deployed as a Web Services Gateway
      Interface (WSGI) application behind an HTTPS proxy such as
      Apache or nginx. If Apache is not already in use, we recommend
      nginx since it is lightweight and easier to configure
      correctly.</para>
    <para>When using nginx, we recommend <link
      xlink:href="http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/deploy.html"
      >gunicorn</link> as the WSGI host with an appropriate number
      of synchronous workers. When using Apache, we recommend
      <literal>mod_wsgi</literal> to host the dashboard.</para>
