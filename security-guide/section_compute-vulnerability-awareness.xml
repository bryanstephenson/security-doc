      We recommend keeping up to date on security issues and advisories
      as they are published. The OpenStack Security Portal
      (<link xlink:href="https://security.openstack.org/">
      https://security.openstack.org/</link>) is the central portal
      where advisories, notices, meetings, and processes can be
      coordinated. Additionally, the OpenStack Vulnerability Management
      Team (VMT) portal (<link
      xlink:href="https://security.openstack.org/#openstack-vulnerability-management-team">
      https://security.openstack.org/#openstack-vulnerability-management-team
      </link>) coordinates remediation within the OpenStack project, as
      well as the process of investigating reported bugs which are
      responsibly disclosed (privately) to the VMT, by marking the bug
      as 'This bug is a security vulnerability'. Further detail is
      outlined in the VMT process page
      (<link xlink:href="https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#process">
      https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#process</link>)
      and results in an OpenStack Security Advisory or OSSA. This OSSA
      outlines the issue and the fix, as well as linking to both the
      original bug, and the location where the where the patch is
      hosted.

    <title>OpenStack security notes</title>
    <para>
      Reported security bugs that are found to be the result of a
      misconfiguration, or are not strictly part of OpenStack are
      drafted into Openstack Security Notes or OSSNs. These include
      configuration issues such as ensuring Identity provider mappings
      as well as non-OpenStack but critical issues such as the
      Bashbug/Ghost or Venom vulnerabilities that affect the platform
      OpenStack utilizes. The current set of OSSNs is in the Security
      Note wiki (<link

    <para>
      All bugs, OSSAs and OSSNs are publicly disseminated through the
      openstack-dev mailinglist with the [security] topic in the subject
      line. We recommend subscribing to this list as well as mail
      filtering rules that ensure OSSNs, OSSAs, and other important
      advisories are not missed. The openstack-dev mailinglist is
      managed through <link

      http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-dev</link>.
      The openstack-dev list has a high traffic rate, and filtering is
      discussed in the thread <link

    <para>
      When implementing OpenStack, one of the core decisions is which
      hypervisor to utilize. We recommend being informed of advisories
      pertaining to the hypervisor(s) you have chosen. Several common
      hypervisor security lists are below:
