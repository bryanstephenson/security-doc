Glance image signature uses an insecure hash algorithm (MD5)
---

### Summary ###
During the Liberty release the Glance project added a feature that
supports verifying images by their signature. There is a flaw in the
implementation that degrades verification by using the weak MD5
algorithm.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Glance, Liberty

### Discussion ###
A signature algorithm is typically created by hashing data and then
encrypting that hash in some way. In the case of the new Glance feature
the signature algorithm does not hash the image to be verified. It
rehashes the existing MD5 checksum that is used to locally verify the
integrity of image data stored in Glance.

The Glance image signature algorithm uses configurable hash algorithms.
No matter which algorithm is used, the overall security of the algorithm
is degraded to that of MD5 because instead of applying it to the image
data it's applied only to the MD5 checksum that already exists in
Glance.

The image signature algorithm is a relatively new feature, introduced in
the Liberty release.

### Recommended Actions ###
Users concerned with image security should be aware that the current
Glance signature algorithm is not secure by todays cryptographic
standards.

A specification for a fix has been proposed by the Glance development
team and is targeted for the Mitaka release.
