Vulnerability awareness
=======================

OpenStack vulnerability management team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend keeping up to date on security issues and advisories as they are
published. The `OpenStack Security Portal
<https://security.openstack.org/>`_ is the central portal where advisories,
notices, meetings, and processes can be coordinated. Additionally, the
`OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team (VMT) portal
<https://security.openstack.org/#vulnerability-management>`_
coordinates remediation within OpenStack, as well as the process of
investigating reported bugs which are responsibly disclosed (privately) to the
VMT, by marking the bug as 'This bug is a security vulnerability'. Further
detail is outlined in the `VMT process page
<https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#process>`_ and results in
an OpenStack Security Advisory (OSSA). This OSSA outlines the issue and the
fix, as well as linking to both the original bug, and the location where the
where the patch is hosted.

OpenStack security notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reported security bugs that are found to be the result of a misconfiguration,
or are not strictly part of OpenStack, are drafted into OpenStack Security
Notes (OSSNs). These include configuration issues such as ensuring identity
provider mappings as well as non-OpenStack, but critical, issues such as the
Bashbug/Ghost or Venom vulnerabilities that affect the platform OpenStack
utilizes. The current set of OSSNs is in the `Security Note wiki
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security_Notes>`_.

OpenStack-discuss mailing list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All bugs, OSSAs and OSSNs are publicly disseminated through the openstack-discuss
mailing list with the [security] topic in the subject line. We recommend
subscribing to this list as well as mail filtering rules that ensure OSSNs,
OSSAs, and other important advisories are not missed. The openstack-discuss
mailinglist is managed through
`http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-discuss
<http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-discuss>`_.
The openstack-discuss uses tags as defined in
the `Project Team Guide <https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/open-community.html#mailing-lists>`_.

Hypervisor mailinglists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When implementing OpenStack, one of the core decisions is which hypervisor to
utilize. We recommend being informed of advisories pertaining to the
hypervisor(s) you have chosen. Several common hypervisor security lists are
below:

Xen:
     `http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/ <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/>`_
VMWare:
     `http://blogs.vmware.com/security/ <http://blogs.vmware.com/security/>`_
Others (KVM, and more):
     `http://seclists.org/oss-sec <http://seclists.org/oss-sec>`_
