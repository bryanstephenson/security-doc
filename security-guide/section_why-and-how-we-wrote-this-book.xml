  <title>Why and how we wrote this book</title>
  <para>As OpenStack adoption continues to grow and the product matures,
    security has become a priority. The OpenStack Security Group has
    recognized the need for a comprehensive and authoritative security
    guide. The <emphasis role="bold">OpenStack Security Guide</emphasis>
    has been written to provide an overview of security best practices,
    guidelines, and recommendations for increasing the security of an
    OpenStack deployment. The authors bring their expertise from deploying
    and securing OpenStack in a variety of environments.</para>
  <para>This guide augments the
    <link xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/ops/">
    <citetitle>OpenStack Operations Guide</citetitle></link> and can be
    referenced to harden existing OpenStack deployments or to evaluate the
    security controls of OpenStack cloud providers.</para>

    <title>How</title>
    <para>As with the OpenStack Operations Guide, we followed the book sprint
      methodology. The book sprint process allows for rapid development and
      production of large bodies of written work. Coordinators from the
      OpenStack Security Group re-enlisted the services of Adam Hyde as
      facilitator. Corporate support was obtained and the project was formally
      announced during the OpenStack summit in Portland, Oregon.</para>
    <para>The team converged in Annapolis, MD due to the close proximity of
      some key members of the group. This was a remarkable collaboration
      between public sector intelligence community members, silicon valley
      startups and some large, well-known technology companies. The book sprint
      ran during the last week in June 2013 and the first edition was created
      in five days.</para>
