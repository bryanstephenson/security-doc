Glance method filtering does not work under certain conditions
---

### Summary ###
Glance is using the Python assert statement for validating the HTTP
method type in its caching middleware for some image endpoints. The
Python documentation states that when optimization is requested
(command line option -O), assert statements will not be evaluated.
This results in a condition where these method validations will not
occur and can allow a specific method to be called with a different
HTTP verb.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Glance, Icehouse, Juno, Kilo

### Discussion ###
Glance uses the Python assert statement to validate the HTTP method
for some of the image endpoints in the version 1 and 2 REST interfaces.
In circumstances where glance is being run with Python optimization
enabled (by using the -O command line option), these assert statements
will not be evaluated. In these cases, the HTTP verb is unchecked for
the requested endpoints.

The endpoints and methods affected by this are the following:

* GET on /v1/images/{image_id}
* DELETE on /v1/images/{image_id}
* GET on /v2/images/{image_id}/file
* DELETE on /v2/images/{image_id}

This can lead to access violations in some configurations. For
example, if filtering were occurring in front of the glance API to
restrict queries based on HTTP method and IP address, an attacker
could circumvent this filtering by matching the endpoint regular
expression and providing a different HTTP verb. In this example
an attacker would be able to download or delete images from glance.

Assuming a user were restricted by network filtering to only send
DELETE requests to the glance API endpoint. The user could attempt to
circumvent the filtering by sending a well crafted request to the
endpoint that would actually retrieve the named image. If an image ID
were known to be "12345", then a DELETE request sent to the glance API
endpoint "/v2/images/12345/file" would end up matching the GET URI
pattern. This would retrieve the image from glance, thus exploiting the
filtering.

### Recommended Actions ###
As of the Kilo-rc1 release of glance, this vulnerability has been
patched. It has also been backported to the stable branch of the Juno
release and will be officially updated in the 2014.2.4 tag of glance.
This will not be fixed for Icehouse.

Kilo deployments should be updated to the rc1 tag. Juno deployments
should be updated to the 2014.2.4 tag. Operators maintaining Icehouse
deployments of glance should consider upgrading to the Juno 2014.2.4
release.
