    <title>Policies</title>
    <para>Each OpenStack service has a policy file in JSON format,
      called <filename>policy.json</filename>. The policy
      file specifies rules, and the rule that governs each resource. A
      resource could be API access, the ability to attach to a volume,
      or to fire up instances.</para>
    <para>The policies can be updated by the cloud administrator to
      further control access to the various resources. The middleware
      could also be further customized. Note that your users must be
      assigned to groups/roles that you refer to in your
      policies.</para>
    <para>Below is a snippet of the Block Storage service
      <filename>policy.json</filename> file.</para>

    <para>Note the <emphasis role="bold">default</emphasis> rule
      specifies that the user must be either an admin or the owner of
      the volume. It essentially says only the owner of a volume or
      the admin may create/delete/update volumes. Certain other
      operations such as managing volume types are accessible only to
      admin users.</para>
