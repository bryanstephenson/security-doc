However, when client side encryption is used for virtual machine images, block storage etc, client intervention is necessary in the form of presenting keys to unlock the data for further use. To seamlessly secure the data and yet have it accessible without burdening the client with having to manage their keys and interactively provide them calls for a key management service within OpenStack. Providing encryption and key management services as part of OpenStack eases data-at-rest security adoption and addresses customer concerns about privacy or misuse of data, while also limiting cloud provider liability.

When configuring the trusted certificate authority (CA) bundle that your messaging server uses to verify client connections, it is recommended that this be limited to only the CA used for your nodes, preferably an internally managed CA. The bundle of trusted CAs will determine which client certificates will be authorized and pass the client-server verification step of the setting up the SSL connection. Note, when installing the certificate and key files, ensure that the file permissions are restricted, for example using <placeholder-1/>, and the ownership is restricted to the messaging server daemon user to prevent unauthorized access by other processes and users on the messaging server."
