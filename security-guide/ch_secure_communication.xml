  <title>Secure communication</title>

  <para>
    Inter-device communication is an issue still plaguing security
    researchers. Between large project errors such as Heartbleed or more
    advanced attacks such as BEAST and CRIME, secure methods of
    communication over a network are becoming more important. It should
    be remembered, however that encryption should be applied as one part
    of a larger security strategy. The compromise of an endpoint means
    that an attacker no longer needs to break the encryption used, but
    is able to view and manipulate messages as they are processed by
    the system.

    This chapter will review several features around configuring TLS to
    secure both internal and external resources, and will call out
    specific categories of systems that should be given specific
    attention.
