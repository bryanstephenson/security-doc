      <title>Static media</title>
      <para>The dashboard's static media should be deployed to a subdomain
        of the dashboard domain and served by the web server. The use of
        an external content delivery network (CDN) is also acceptable.
        This subdomain should not set cookies or serve user-provided
        content. The media should also be served with HTTPS.</para>
      <para>Django media settings are documented in the <link
          xlink:href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/"
          >Django documentation</link>.</para>
      <para>Dashboard's default configuration uses <link
          xlink:href="http://django-compressor.readthedocs.org/"
          >django_compressor</link> to compress and minify CSS and
        JavaScript content before serving it. This process should be
        statically done before deploying the dashboard, rather than using
        the default in-request dynamic compression and copying the
        resulting files along with deployed code or to the CDN server.
        Compression should be done in a non-production build
        environment. If this is not practical, we recommend disabling
        resource compression entirely. Online compression dependencies
        (less, Node.js) should not be installed on production
        machines.</para>
