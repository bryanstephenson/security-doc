      The Data processing service for OpenStack (sahara) provides a platform
      for the provisioning and management of instance clusters using processing
      frameworks such as Hadoop and Spark. Through the OpenStack dashboard
      or REST API, users will be able to upload and execute framework
      applications which may access data in object storage or external
      providers. The data processing controller uses the Orchestration
      service to create clusters of instances which may exist as
      long-running groups that can grow and shrink as requested, or as
      transient groups created for a single workload.
