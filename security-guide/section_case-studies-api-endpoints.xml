    <title>Case studies</title>
    <para>Earlier in <xref linkend="introduction-to-case-studies"/> we introduced the Alice and Bob case studies where Alice is deploying a private government cloud and Bob is deploying a public cloud each with different security requirements. Here we discuss how Alice and Bob would address endpoint configuration to secure their private and public clouds. Alice's cloud is not publicly accessible, but she is still concerned about securing the endpoints against improper use. Bob's cloud, being public, must take measures to reduce the risk of attacks by external adversaries.</para>

      <title>Alice's private cloud</title>
      <para>
        Alice's organization requires that the security architecture
        protect the access to the private endpoints, so she elects to
        use Apache with TLS enabled and HAProxy for load balancing in
        front of the web service. As Alice's organization has
        implemented its own certificate authority, she configures the
        services within both the guest and management security domains
        to use these certificates. Since Alice's OpenStack deployment
        exists entirely on a network disconnected from the Internet, she
        makes sure to remove all default CA bundles that contain
        external public CA providers to ensure the OpenStack services
        only accept client certificates issued by her agency's CA. As
        she is using HAProxy, Alice configures SSL offloading on her
        load balancer, and a virtual server IP (VIP) on the load
        balancer with the http to https redirection policy to her API
        endpoint systems.
      </para>
      <para>Alice has registered all of the services in the
        Identity service's catalog, using the internal URLs for access
        by internal services. She has installed host-based intrusion
        detection (HIDS) to monitor the security events on the
        endpoints. On the hosts, Alice also ensures that the API
        services are confined to a network namespace while confirming
        that there is a robust SELinux profile applied to the services.

      <title>Bob's public cloud</title>
      <para>
        Bob must also protect the access to the public and private
        endpoints, so he elects to use the Apache TLS proxy on both
        public and internal services. On the public services, he has
        configured the certificate key files with certificates signed
        by a well-known Certificate Authority. He has used his
        organization's self-signed CA to sign certificates in the
        internal services on the Management network. Bob has
        registered his services in the Identity service's catalog,
        using the internal URLs for access by internal services. Bob's
        public cloud runs services on SELinux, which he has configured
        with a mandatory access control policy to reduce the impact of
        any publicly accessible services that may be compromised. He
        has also configured the endpoints with a host-based IDS.
