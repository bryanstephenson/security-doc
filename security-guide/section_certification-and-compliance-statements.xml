  <title>Certification and compliance statements</title>
  <para>Compliance and security are not exclusive, and must be
    addressed together. OpenStack deployments are unlikely to satisfy
    compliance requirements without security hardening. The listing
    below provides an OpenStack architect foundational knowledge and
    guidance to achieve compliance against commercial and government
    certifications and standards.</para>
  <section
    xml:id="certification-and-compliance-statements-idp44896">
    <title>Commercial standards</title>
    <para>For commercial deployments of OpenStack, it is recommended
      that SOC 1/2 combined with ISO 2700 1/2 be considered as a
      starting point for OpenStack certification activities. The
      required security activities mandated by these certifications
      facilitate a foundation of security best practices and common
      control criteria that can assist in achieving more stringent
      compliance activities, including government attestations and
      certifications.</para>
    <para>After completing these initial certifications, the remaining
      certifications are more deployment specific. For example, clouds
      processing credit card transactions will need PCI-DSS, clouds
      storing health care information require HIPAA, and clouds within
      the federal government may require FedRAMP/FISMA, and ITAR,
      certifications.</para>

        SOC controls assess relevant financial statements and
        assertions of a service provider, such as compliance with the
        Sarbanes-Oxley Act. SOC 1 is a replacement for Statement on

    <title>HIPAA / HITECH</title>
    <para>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
      (HIPAA) is a United States congressional act that governs the
      collection, storage, use and destruction of patient health
      records. The act states that Protected Health Information (PHI)
      must be rendered "unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable" to
      unauthorized persons and that encryption for data 'at-rest' and
      'inflight' should be addressed.</para>
    <para>HIPAA is not a certification, rather a guide for protecting
      healthcare data. Similar to the PCI-DSS, the most important
      issues with both PCI and HIPPA is that a breach of credit card
      information, and health data, does not occur. In the instance of a
      breach the cloud provider will be scrutinized for compliance
      with PCI and HIPPA controls. If proven compliant, the provider
      can be expected to immediately implement remedial controls,
      breach notification responsibilities, and significant
      expenditure on additional compliance activities. If not
      compliant, the cloud provider can expect on-site audit teams,
      fines, potential loss of merchant ID (PCI), and massive
      reputation impact.</para>
    <para>Users or organizations that possess PHI must support HIPAA
      requirements and are HIPAA covered entities. If an entity
      intends to use a service, or in this case, an OpenStack cloud
      that might use, store or have access to that PHI, then a
      Business Associate Agreement must be signed. The BAA is a
      contract between the HIPAA covered entity and the OpenStack
      service provider that requires the provider to handle that PHI
      in accordance with HIPAA requirements. If the service provider
      does not handle the PHI, such as with security controls and
      hardening, then they are subject to HIPAA fines and
      penalties.</para>
    <para>OpenStack architects interpret and respond to HIPAA
      statements, with data encryption remaining a core practice.
      Currently this would require any protected health information
      contained within an OpenStack deployment to be encrypted with
      industry standard encryption algorithms. Potential future
      OpenStack projects such as object encryption will facilitate
      HIPAA guidelines for compliance with the act.</para>

      <title>PCI-DSS</title>
      <para>The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
        is defined by the Payment Card Industry Standards Council, and
        created to increase controls around card holder data to reduce
        credit card fraud. Annual compliance validation is assessed by
        an external Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) who creates a
        Report on Compliance (ROC), or by a Self-Assessment
        Questionnaire (SAQ) dependent on volume of card-holder
        transactions.</para>
      <para>OpenStack deployments which stores, processes, or
        transmits payment card details are in scope for the PCI-DSS.
        All OpenStack components that are not properly segmented from
        systems or networks that handle payment data fall under the
        guidelines of the PCI-DSS. Segmentation in the context of
        PCI-DSS does not support multi-tenancy, but rather physical
        separation (host/network).</para>
