Pre-auth COPY in versioned_writes can result in a successful COPY that
wouldn't have been authorized
---

### Summary ###
This issue is related to the versioning feature of swift and potentially
allows unauthorized users to drive up the storage usage of a third party
account.

Specifically a user can create versions of existing objects belonging to
projects for which he has no authorization. The malicious user cannot
read or write the specific object, or create objects with arbitrary content.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Swift < 2.10.0

### Discussion ###
A versioned write PUT uses a pre-authed request to move an object into
the versioned container before checking whether the user is authorized.
So a user can select a versioned object path that it does not have access to,
request a put on that versioned object, and the request will execute the copy
part before it fails due to lack of permissions.

### Recommended Actions ###
Update Swift to version 2.10.0 where possible.
