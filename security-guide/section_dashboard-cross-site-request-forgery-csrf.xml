      <title>Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</title>
      <para>Django has dedicated middleware for cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
        For further details, see the <link xlink:href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/">
        Django documentation</link>.</para>
      <para>Dashboard is designed to discourage developers from
        introducing cross-site scripting vulnerabilities with custom
        dashboards. However, it is important to audit custom dashboards,
        especially ones that are JavaScript-heavy for inappropriate use
        of the <literal>@csrf_exempt</literal> decorator. Dashboards
        which do not follow these recommended security settings should
        be carefully evaluated before restrictions are relaxed.</para>
