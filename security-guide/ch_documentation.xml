  <title>System documentation</title>

  <para>The system documentation for an OpenStack cloud deployment
    should follow the templates and best practices for the Enterprise
    Information Technology System in your organization. Organizations
    often have compliance requirements which may require an overall
    System Security Plan to inventory and document the architecture of a
    given system. There are common challenges across the industry
    related to documenting the dynamic cloud infrastructure and keeping
    the information up-to-date.</para>
