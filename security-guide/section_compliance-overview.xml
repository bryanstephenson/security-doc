  <title>Compliance overview</title>
  <para>An OpenStack deployment may require compliance activities for many purposes, such as
    regulatory and legal requirements, customer need, privacy considerations, and security best
    practices. The Compliance function is important for the business and its customers. Compliance
    means adhering to regulations, specifications, standards and laws. It is also used when
    describing an organizations status regarding assessments, audits, and certifications.
    Compliance, when done correctly, unifies and strengthens the other security topics discussed in
    this guide.</para>
  <para>This chapter has several objectives:</para>

  <section xml:id="compliance-overview-security-principles">
    <title>Security principles</title>
    <para>Industry standard security principles provide a baseline for compliance certifications and
      attestations. If these principles are considered and referenced throughout an OpenStack
      deployment, certification activities may be simplified.</para>

        <term>Layered defenses</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Identify where risks exist in a cloud architecture and apply controls to mitigate
            the risks. In areas of significant concern, layered defences provide multiple
            complementary controls to manage risk down to an acceptable level. For example, to ensure adequate
            isolation between cloud tenants, we recommend hardening QEMU, using a hypervisor with
            SELinux support, enforcing mandatory access control policies, and reducing the overall
            attack surface. The foundational principle is to harden an area of concern with multiple
            layers of defense such that if any one layer is compromised, other layers will exist to
            offer protection and minimize exposure.</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Fail securely</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>In the case of failure, systems should be configured to fail into a closed secure
            state. For example, TLS certificate verification should fail closed by severing the
            network connection if the CNAME doesn't match the server's DNS name. Software often
            fails open in this situation, allowing the connection to proceed without a CNAME match,
            which is less secure and not recommended.</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Least privilege</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Only the minimum level of access for users and system services is granted. This
            access is based upon role, responsibility and job function. This security principal of
            least privilege is written into several international government security policies, such
            as NIST 800-53 Section AC-6 within the United States.</para>

        <term>Compartmentalize</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Systems should be segregated in a such way that if one machine, or system-level
            service, is compromised the security of the other systems will remain intact.
            Practically, the enablement and proper usage of SELinux helps accomplish this
            goal.</para>

          <para>Appropriate logging is implemented to monitor for unauthorized use, incident
            response and forensics. It is highly recommended that selected audit subsystems be
            Common Criteria certified, which provides non-attestable event records in most
            countries.</para>

          <para>The CSA CCM is specifically designed to provide fundamental security principles to
            guide cloud vendors and to assist prospective cloud customers in assessing the overall
            security risk of a cloud provider. The CSA CCM provides a controls framework that are
            aligned across 16 security domains. The foundation of the Cloud Controls Matrix rests on
            its customized relationship to other industry standards, regulations, and controls
            frameworks such as: ISO 27001:2013, COBIT 5.0, PCI:DSS v3, AICPA 2014 Trust Service
            Principles and Criteria and augments internal control direction for service organization

          <para>The CSA CCM strengthens existing information security control environments by
            enabling the reduction of security threats and vulnerabilities in the cloud, provides
            standardized security and operational risk management, and seeks to normalize security

    <title>Audit reference</title>
    <para>OpenStack is innovative in many ways however the process used to audit an OpenStack
      deployment is fairly common. Auditors will evaluate a process by two criteria: Is the
      control designed effectively and if the control is operating effectively. An understanding of
      how an auditor evaluates if a control is designed and operating effectively will be discussed
      in <xref linkend="understanding-the-audit-process"/>.</para>
    <para>The most common frameworks for auditing and evaluating a cloud deployment include the
      previously mentioned ISO 27001/2 Information Security standard,  ISACA's Control Objectives
      for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) framework, Committee of Sponsoring
      Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and Information Technology Infrastructure
      Library (ITIL).  It is very common for audits to include areas of focus from one or more of
      these frameworks.  Fortunately there is a lot of overlap between the frameworks, so an
      organization that adopts one will be in a good position come audit time.</para>
