Horizon dashboard leaks internal information through cookies
---

### Summary ###
When horizon is configured, its URL contains the IP address of
the internal URL of keystone, as the default value for the identity
service is "internalURL".[1]

The cookie "login_region" will be set to the value configured as
OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_URL, given in the local_settings.py file.

Usually, the OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_URL is the publicURL, and hence
the cookie URL will also be the public one. If set to internal URL
(by default), then the login cookie URL will be the internal URL or IP.
So, by putting the OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_URL in the cookie that is sent to
the public network, horizon leaks the values of the internal network IP
address.

### Affected Services and Software ###

### Discussion ###
This is not a bug in horizon, but a possible misconfiguration issue.

Exposing the internal URL is not a bug, since one can view the internal
URL as it's a freely accessible endpoint to authorized users, or
it's hidden behind a firewall. Also, the data for internal URLs are
freely available in the catalog and the catalog is not considered
private information.
