Heap and Stack based buffer overflows in dnsmasq prior to version 2.78
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Summary ###
A series of heap and stack based buffer overflows have been discovered in
versions of dnsmasq prior to release 2.78.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Any neutron based OpenStack deployment on a version of dnsmasq prior to
2.78.

### Discussion ###
The following attack vectors have been assigned the following CVE numbers.

* CVE-2017-14491
* CVE-2017-14492
* CVE-2017-14493
* CVE-2017-14494
* CVE-2017-14495
* CVE-2017-14496
* CVE-2017-13704

Each of these CVE's exposes a neutron based OpenStack deployment to various
attacks such as leakage of sensitive memory information or causing a denial of
service. Nodes are exposed to this risk by the crafting of various nefarious
DNS or DHCP requests.

### Recommended Actions ###
Operators should update the dnsmasq service using the affected nodes operating
systems packaging tools to version 2.78 and later, or a distribution packaged
version that contains relevant backports for these vulnerabilities.
