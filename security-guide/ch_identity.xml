  <para>Identity service (keystone) provides identity, token, catalog,
  and policy services for use specifically by services in the OpenStack
  family. Identity service is organized as a group of internal services
  exposed on one or many endpoints. Many of these services are used in a
  combined fashion by the frontend, for example an authenticate call
  will validate user/project credentials with the identity service and,
  upon success, create and return a token with the token service.
