      <para>Django security releases are generally well tested and
        aggressively backwards compatible. In almost all cases, new
        major releases of Django are also fully backwards compatible
        with previous releases. Dashboard implementers are strongly
        encouraged to run the latest stable release of Django with
        up-to-date security releases.</para>
