Glance configuration option can lead to privilege escalation
---

### Summary ###
Glance exposes a configuration option called `use_user_token` in the
configuration file `glance-api.conf`.  It should be noted that the
default setting (`True`) is secure.  If, however, the setting is
changed to `False` and valid admin credentials are supplied in the
following section (`admin_user` and `admin_password`), Glance API
commands will be executed with admin privileges regardless of the
intended privilege level of the calling user.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Glance, Juno, Kilo, Liberty

### Discussion ###

The `use_user_token` configuration option was created to enable
automatic re-authentication for tokens whch are close to expiration,
thus preventing the tokens from expiring in the middle of
longer-lasting Glance commands.  Unfortunately the implementation
enables privilege escalation attacks by automatically executing API
commands as an administrator level user.

By default `use_user_token` is set to `True` which is secure.  If the
option is disabled (set to `False`) and valid admin credentials are
specified in the `glance-api.conf` file, API commands will be executed
as the supplied admin user regardless of the intended privileges of the
calling user.  Glance API v2 configurations which don't enable the
registry service (`data_api = glance.db.registry.api`) aren't affected.

Enabling unauthenticated and lower privileged users to execute Glance
commands with administrator privileges is very dangerous and may
expose risks including:

 - tampering with images
 - deleting images
 - denial of service attacks

### Recommended Actions ###
A comprehensive fix will be included in the Mitaka release.  Meanwhile
it is recommended that all users ensure that `use_user_token` is left
at the default setting (`True`) or commented out.
