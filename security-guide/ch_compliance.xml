  <para>
    An OpenStack deployment may require compliance activities for many
    purposes, such as regulatory and legal requirements, customer need,
    privacy considerations, and security best practices. The Compliance
    function is important for the business and its customers. Compliance
    means adhering to regulations, specifications, standards and laws.
    It is also used when describing an organizations status regarding
    assessments, audits, and certifications. Compliance, when done
    correctly, unifies and strengthens the other security topics
    discussed in this guide.
