    <title>Case studies</title>
    <para>Earlier in <xref linkend="introduction-to-case-studies"/> we introduced the Alice and Bob case studies where Alice is deploying a government cloud and Bob is deploying a public cloud each with different security requirements. Here we discuss how Alice and Bob would address their system documentation requirements. The documentation suggested above includes hardware and software records, network diagrams, and system configuration details.</para>

      <title>Alice's private cloud</title>
      <para>As Alice needs detailed documentation to satisfy FISMA and
        FedRAMP requirements, she implements Microsoft's Systems Center
        due to its established auditing capabilities to support FedRAMP
        artifact creation, including capturing hardware, firmware, and
        software details. Architecture docs are created that clearly
        define the components, services, and data flows, with supporting
        materials listing the details of those services including
        processes, protocols, and ports used. These documents are then
        stored on a secured file share, allowing authenticated access
        for service and architecture teams to reference.</para>
      <para>Additionally, the security domains are clearly highlighted
        on each document, and asset groups are categorized per the NIST
        Risk Management Framework. Specifically, Alice will call out the
        fact that several services cross security domains, such as the
        API endpoints crossing the Public and Management domains, the
        Identity data being served from a Federated entity crossing
        from a system she does not manage to her Management domain, the
        Database service crossing both Data and Guest domains, and
        hypervisor crossing Management, Guest, and Public domains. She
        will then be able to dictate additional controls that ensure
        and reinforce the trust level of each domain. For example, the
        application will be exposed to the Internet, and therefore data
        coming through that will initially be untrusted before it is
        moved through to the data domain and into the database.</para>

      <para>In this case, Bob will approach these steps the same as Alice.</para>
