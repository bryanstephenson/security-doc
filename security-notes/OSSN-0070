Bandit versions lower than 1.1.0 do not escape HTML in issue reports
---

### Summary ###
Bandit versions lower than 1.1.0 have a bug in the HTML report formatter that
does not escape HTML in issue context snippets. This could lead to an XSS if
HTML reports are hosted as part of a CI pipeline.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Bandit: < 1.1.0

### Discussion ###
Bandit versions lower than 1.1.0 have a bug in the HTML report formatter that
does not escape HTML in issue context snippets. This could lead to an XSS
attack if HTML reports are hosted as part of a CI pipeline because HTML in the
source code would be copied verbatim into the report. For example:

  import subprocess
  subprocess.Popen("<script>alert(1)</script>", shell=True)

Will cause "<script>alert(1)</script>" to be inserted into the HTML report.
This issue could allow for arbitrary code injection into CI/CD pipelines that
feature accessible HTML reports generated from Bandit runs.

### Recommended Actions ###
Update bandit to version 1.1.0 or greater.
