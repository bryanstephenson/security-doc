Nova and Cinder key manager for Barbican misuses cached credentials
---

### Summary ###
During the Icehouse release the Cinder and Nova projects added a
feature that supports storage volume encryption using keys stored in
Barbican. The Barbican key manager, that is part of Nova and
Cinder, had a bug that could cause an authorized user to lose access to an
encryption key or allow the wrong user to gain access to an encryption key.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Cinder: Icehouse, Juno, Kilo, Liberty
Nova: Juno, Kilo, Liberty

### Discussion ###
The Barbican key manager is a feature that is part of Nova and Cinder to
allow those projects to create and retrieve keys in Barbican. The key
manager includes a cache function that allows for a copy_key() operation
to work while only validating the token once with Keystone.

This cache function had a bug such that the cached token was used for
operations where it was no longer valid. The symptoms of this error vary, but
include a user not being able to access their key or the wrong user being
able to access a key.

An affected user would see an error similar to this in their cinder log.

### Recommended Actions ###
Users wishing to use the Barbican key manager to provided keys for volume
encryption with Nova and Cinder should ensure they are using a patched
version.

A specification for a fix has been merged for the Mitaka
release of both Nova and Cinder. Additionally these patches have been
backported to stable/kilo and stable/liberty.
